- 1. I deployed an vagrant box first, by using vagrant init  ubuntu/trusty64 command to launch the OS image into the vagrantfile and then enabling the vm.box.
2.	Later, I placed the VM on the network by guest and host appropriate port numbers and assigning static ip to the guest machine.
3.	I also explored the syncd floder feature by creating a file ‘samplefile.txt’ in the host machine and accessed it through the guest machine.
4.	I created a shell script to update the machine and install apache2 in the guest machine and verified by running apache page in the browser of the guest machine. I got to learn the concept of port forwarding.
5.	I created a multi-machine topology of ubuntu VMs and ran them successfully.
